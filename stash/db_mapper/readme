This is the top directory of the db_mapper's process. Db_mapper is a responder
publisher emirates process that provides an interface to MySQL database for
most of the CRUD operations. To compile the db_mapper run make under the src
directory. Db_mapper also depends on two trema library files wrapper.c and
trema_wrapper.c. Db_mapper accepts a number of options some of them explained
below.
The -c <config_fn> option instructs db_mapper to read a configuration file
other than the default (db_mapper.conf). This file contains database connection
inormation in order for db_mapper to function properly.
The -s <schema_fn> option instructs db_mapper to read a schema file that should
contain an array of records db_mapper is capable of handling. 
The -f <request_reply_schema> option instructs db_mapper to read a schema file
that should contain the request reply record and the "save_all" message format.
For all the other operations that db_mapper is capable of processing ie. 
find_record schema information is not necessary.
The -r <create_db> instructs db_mapper to drop an existing database and create
the database again when it receives the subscription "save_all". For testing
purposes this option might not be necessary since it is useful at times to
keep the already created database.
The tests directory contains some test programs to test the db_mapper.
To compile them run make under the tests directory.
Please note that in order to execute them you also need the emirates proxy
programs (zrequester_responder/zxpub_sub) to run in advance.
