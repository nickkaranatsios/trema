This is the top directory of the emirates library. It is a library that
supports IPC using zmq. The library depends on the czmq library that has
been modified slightly from the original and can be found under czmq directory.
The czmq in turn depends on the sodium library that needs to be pre-installed.
To compile the emirates library go to the src directory and run make.
The make program should create the emirates library and two proxy programs
zrequester_responder and zxpub_sub. One or both of those programs need to run
when using the emirates library.
Emirates library would only transmit json data converted from a jedex value
with the help of a schema. Similarly emirates receives json data that is in
most cases converted to jedex value before being passed to application.
There is also a tests directory with some sample programs that test the emirates
library. To compile those programs run make in the tests directory.
A test program execution order is important that is mentioned below.
For example to run the subscriber_only test program first run the zxpub_sub
program under src. Then execute the ./subscriber_only followed by 
./publisher_only. The publisher_only would pusblish some data and exit.
Similary to run the responder_only test program first start the
zrequester_responder program under src, then execute ./responder_only followed
by the ./requester_only. The requester_only should send a request and wait for
a reply from the responder.
When time permits would create tests scripts to execute the test programs
automatically.
